# MapleFedNet
MapleFedNet is a .NET Standard wrapper for the [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) API.

MapleFedNet is based on [Mastodon.Net](https://github.com/Tlaster/Mastodon.Net), but with a few major changes:

* Functions that take parameters for both domain and access token now combine
  them into one parameter of type `IMastodonCredentials`
* Toot IDs are now treated as alphanumeric strings (for Pleroma compatibility)
* `params T[]` parameters and optional parameters are no longer used in the same methods

# Sample

```
var domain = "mstdn.jp";
var clientName = "MapleFedNet";
var userName = "";
var password = "";

var oauth = await Apps.Register(domain, clientName, scopes: new[] {Scope.Follow, Scope.Read, Scope.Write});
var token = await OAuth.GetAccessTokenByPassword(domain, oauth.ClientId, oauth.ClientSecret, userName, password, Scope.Follow, Scope.Read, Scope.Write);

var credentials = new MastodonCredentials(domain, token.AccessToken);
var timeline = await Timelines.Home(credentials);
var notify = await Notifications.Fetching(credentials);
var toot = await Statuses.Posting(credentials, "Toot!");
```
